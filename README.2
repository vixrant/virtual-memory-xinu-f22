* File additions/ Modules
** frameblock.c
- Adds functions for blocking processes waiting on frames
- Implements a circular queue using array

** pgfutil.c
- Implements modular functions for each case of page fault handling
- Each function is unit testable and runs with certain assumptions

** testlab5.c and testlab6.c
- Separates out the testing code from main.c

* File changes
** vmhfreemem.c
- Now calls framewakeup() to wake up blocked processes
- Added check for seg faults

** pgfhandler.c
- Removed logic for handling frames into pgfutil.c
- Now only sets up the state and debug information of the system

** pgfdisp.c
- Some weird issue where I need two pushal and popal for kprintf to work in interrupts??
- Common issue with other classmates

** pagingmgmt.c
- Added function to delete a page table when it is empty

** kill.c
- Calls framewakeup() after freeing frames

** framemgmt.c
- Added FIFO linked List
- Added object-oriented functions has() and next() for stack and queue

** paging.h
- Make use of avail bits in PTE for marking VF -> E2 mappings separate from VF -> E1 mappings
